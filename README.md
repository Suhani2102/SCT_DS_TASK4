📌 Task 4: US Accidents Data Analysis

🔍 Objective

To analyze the US Accidents dataset to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The goal was to uncover trends and visualize accident hotspots using diverse chart types.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

•Python

•Pandas

•Matplotlib

•Seaborn

•Plotly

•Jupyter Notebook

📊 Steps Performed

•Data Import & Cleaning

•Extracted data from a ZIP file

•Handled missing values and filtered necessary columns

•Feature Engineering

•Converted time columns to datetime

•Extracted hour and day of week

•Sampled data where needed for visualization performance

•Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

•Created more than 10 visualizations using multiple chart types:

•Count plots

•Pie chart

•Box plot

•Line plot

•Histogram

•Scatter plots

•KDE plot

•Joint plot

•Interactive map using Plotly

📈 Key Visualizations Created

•Accidents by hour of day

•Accidents by day of week

•Distribution of accident severity

•Weather conditions during accidents

•Monthly accident trend

•Temperature vs Visibility (Scatter)

•Wind Speed vs Humidity (Scatter)

•KDE of accident temperatures

•Visibility vs Distance (Joint Plot)

•Interactive geographical scatter map of accident locations

📌 Insights

•Most accidents occurred during peak traffic hours.

•Fridays and weekdays showed a higher frequency of accidents.

•Clear weather was still the most common condition during accidents.

•Severity level 2 was most frequent.

•Accidents mostly occurred when visibility was moderate to good, but with increasing traffic density.

•A wide range of temperatures were seen during accidents, with a majority between 40°F–80°F.

🧠 Learnings

•Extracting and manipulating time-based features.

•Handling real-world, messy data.

•Visualizing spatial data with Plotly.

•Using KDE and joint plots to reveal distribution and relationships.

•Applying different types of plots for storytelling through data.
